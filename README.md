## A Quick Note
The reason why (if you where wondering) none of the pull requests go through Travis CI or Circle CI before getting merged is because, first, I haven’t really figured it out yet (I’d love some help), second, the project is so small I don’t really need it (but I’d like it), third, I like testing out the builds myself, so it fits really well. An that’s why!
